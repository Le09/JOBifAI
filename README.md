# JOBifAI (that time I got the job interview at Grizley)

This is an experimental Visual Novel that uses AI to generate images and text.
The gameplay is something that could not exist without AI; you have to bullshit your way to win, and you need to do so based on the AI-generated images.

Each playthrough is unique thanks to these features, and the game is designed to be replayed multiple times.

You can play the game for free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3248650/JOBifAI/)!
You can also get a build directly on [itch.io](https://okfeather.itch.io/jobifai).

## An AI augmented visual novel.

This is a work of fiction. 
Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the author’s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

## Roadmap

Version 1.0 is done :-)

Maybe?
- add more configuration options to be able to use comfyUI instead or CloudFlare
- distribute the function as ren'py libraries (?)

## Building the game

The makefile assumes that the Ren'Py SDK has been downloaded in the same folder as the parent directory of this file. If it is not, you can change the `RENPY` variable at the top of  the makefile to point to the correct location. Then you can build the game by running:

```bash
make
```

The makefile also ensure that the session images that are created in the `game/images/session*` folder are moved to a temporary directory before building the game.
Otherwise, the images would be included in the build, bloating it for no reason.
Images are moved back after the build is done, since otherwise that would break the corresponding save files.

## Steam version

The ability to configure the keys was refused by Steam.
Steam asked for the game to handle the keys itself via in-app purchases.
The defeats the initial purpose to have the game run in fully private mode, without any third-party knowledge of your own requests (or without any internet connection).

The steam branch is thus different; it hardcodes calls to Woolion's server, which requires Steam authentication (to prevent abuse). 
To avoid round trips, almost all the AI logic is removed from this branch, and performed on the server. 
Image generation on Steam is using Replicate.
It would be possible to use Replicate on the itch.io version as well, it is not done this way as they do not provide a free tier.

Also note that the steam version needs a version or Renpy that includes [the Steam authentication fix](https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/5899) to work (at least version [8.3.3](https://www.renpy.org/release/8.3.3)).

## Transcripts

The interactive lines start with a "_   ", non-interactive lines with "    ".
To generate the transcripts, you can define the following command:

```bash
function transcript {
    grep '^_' $1 > "${1%.*}_strip.${1##*.}"
}
```
Which then only keeps the interactive lines.

### Development tools
The game engine is [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/).

Images are generated by SDXL using [CloudFlare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/rest-api/). 
It works super well, his very easy, and has a very generous free tier.

The LLM is provided by [Groq](https://groq.com/), which also has a generous free tier.
The calls are made using the standard REST OpeanAI API, so any other compatible service works, including local AI with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). 
You just need to go into advanced settings and change the URL and model.

We are very grateful to Mélanie for her help debugging non-free platforms and finding quite a number of bugs that inexplicably had found their way into the game. 
Other playtesters include the musicians above, who we can't thank enough for their support, as well as E.
