# JOBifAI (that time I got the job interview at Grizley)

## An AI augmented visual novel.

This is a work of fiction. 
Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the authorâ€™s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

## Roadmap

TODO:
- Show the series image side by side with the portfolio!
- Let the player have the good ending?
- make the text input scrollable? (or bigger?)
- maybe add a smoother transition for the secretary's arrival, or moving to the office?
- Add music
- fix sys path issues
- Download the images asynchronously if possible (not in web)
- Make an itch.io branch where API keys settings are removed and instead hardcoded

Maybe?
- add more configuration options to support local AI (ollama, comfyUI)
- distribute the function as ren'py libraries (?)
