# JOBifAI (that time I got the job interview at Grizley)

## An AI augmented visual novel.

This is a work of fiction. 
Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the authorâ€™s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

## Installation

This game is made with Ren'Py, a visual novel engine.

To play, you will need two API keys to process the AI calls needed to make this game work.
These accounts are free and will give you enough free call to play the game as much as you want.

(we are not affiliated to these services, they just seemed the most convenient)

## Roadmap

TODO:
- Show the series image side by side with the portfolio!
- Let the player have the good ending?
- make the text input scrollable? (or bigger?)
- maybe add a smoother transition for the secretary's arrival, or moving to the office?
- Add music
- fix sys path issues
- Download the images asynchronously if possible (not in web)
- Make an itch.io branch where API keys settings are removed and instead hardcoded

Maybe?
- add more configuration options to support local AI (ollama, comfyUI)
- distribute the function as ren'py libraries (?)
