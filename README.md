# JOBifAI (that time I got the job interview at Grizley)

This is an experimental Visual Novel that uses AI to generate images and text.
The gameplay is something that could not exist without AI; you have to bullshit your way to win, and you need to do so based on the AI-generated images.

Each playthrough is unique thanks to these features, and the game is designed to be replayed multiple times.

## An AI augmented visual novel.

This is a work of fiction. 
Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the author’s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

## Roadmap

Version 1.0 is done :-)

Maybe?
- add more configuration options to be able to use comfyUI instead or Prodia
- distribute the function as ren'py libraries (?)

## Building the game

The game use "demo keys" variable to make builds directly usable without the need to create new accounts or keys.
To make this work, the build script replaces the demo keys placeholders by the actual values in the file `.keys.rc`, expecting to give a value to `groq_api_key` and `prodia_api_key`.
The build script reverts this change after the build is done.

To avoid the risk of committing the keys, the `.keys.rc` file is ignored by git, and you should install the commit hook to ensure that the project is not commited while the keys have been changed.

To set up the Git hooks in your local environment, run the following command after cloning the repository:

```bash
./setup-hooks.sh
```

The makefile assumes that the Ren'Py SDK has been downloaded in the same folder as the parent directory of this file. If it is not, you can change the `RENPY` variable at the top of  the makefile to point to the correct location. Then you can build the game by running:

```bash
make
```

If you want to build the game without bundling it with demo keys, you can simply run:

```bash
make no_demo
```

If you intend to distribute the game this way, make sure to update the disclaimer.

The makefile also ensure that the session images that are created in the `game/images/session*` folder are moved to a temporary directory before building the game.
Otherwise, the images would be included in the build, bloating it for no reason.
Images are moved back after the build is done, since otherwise that would break the corresponding save files.

## Transcripts

The interactive lines start with a "_   ", non-interactive lines with "    ".
To generate the transcripts, you can define the following command:

```bash
function transcript {
    grep '^_' $1 > "${1%.*}_strip.${1##*.}"
}
```
Which then only keeps the interactive lines.

### Development tools
The game engine is [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/).

Images are generated by SDXL using [Prodia](https://prodia.com/). 
It works super well, his very easy, and has a very generous free tier.

The LLM is provided by [Groq](https://groq.com/), which also has a generous free tier.
The calls are made using the standard REST OpeanAI API, so any other compatible service works, including local AI with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). 
You just need to go into advanced settings and change the URL and model.

We are very grateful to Mélanie for her help debugging non-free platforms and finding quite a number of bugs that inexplicably had found their way into the game. 
Other playtesters include the musicians above, who we can't thank enough for their support, as well as E.
