# JOBifAI (that time I got the job interview at Grizley)

## An AI augmented visual novel.

This is a work of fiction. 
Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the authorâ€™s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

## Roadmap

TODO:
- let the user respond first to the interviewer; if confidence is low, make the AD explain that `portfolio_idea` should be explained to fit with `series_idea`
- make the text input scrollable? (or bigger?)
- Add music
- still some better error handling, also auto-retry on some errors

Maybe?
- add more configuration options to support local AI (ollama, comfyUI)
- distribute the function as ren'py libraries (?)
- build a 'demo' version with hardcoded keys to show off the concept
